23,1,"When you sit to dine with a ruler, note well what is before you."
23,2,"and put a knife to your throat if you are given to gluttony."
23,3,"Do not crave his delicacies, for that food is deceptive."
23,4,"Do not wear yourself out to get rich; have the wisdom to show restraint."
23,5,"Cast but a glance at riches, and they are gone, for they will surely sprout wings and fly off to the sky like an eagle."
23,6,"Do not eat the food of a stingy man, do not crave his delicacies."
23,7,"for he is the kind of man who is always thinking about the cost. 'Eat and drink,' he says to you, but his heart is not with you."
23,8,"You will vomit up the little you have eaten and will have wasted your compliments."
23,9,"Do not speak to a fool, for he will scorn the wisdom of your words."
23,10,"Do not move an ancient boundary stone or encroach on the field of the fatherless,"
23,11,"for their Defender is strong; he will take up their case against you."
23,12,"Apply your heart to instruction and your ears to words of knowledge."
23,13,"Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you punish him with the rod, he will not die."
23,14,"Punish him with the rod and save his soul from his death."
23,15,"My son, if your heart is wise, then my heart will be glad;"
23,16,"my inmost being will rejoice when your lips speak what is right."
23,17,"Do not let your heart envy sinners, but always be zealous for the fear of the LORD."
23,18,"There is surely a future hope for you, and your hope will not be cut off."
23,19,"Listen, my son and be wise, and keep your heart on the right path."
23,20,"Do not join those who drink too much wine and gorge themselves on meat,"
23,21,"for drunkards and gluttons become poor, and drowsieness clothes them in rags."
23,22,"Listen to your father, who gave you life, and do not despise your mother when she is old."
23,23,"Buy the truth and do not sell it; get wisdom, discipline and understanding."
23,24,"The father of a righteous man has great joy; he who has a wise son delights in him."
23,25,"May your father and mother be glad; may she who gave you birth rejoice!"
23,26,"My son, give me your heart and let your eyes keep to my ways,"
23,27,"for a prostitute is a deep pit and a wayward wife is a narrow well."
23,28,"Like a bandit she lies in wait, and multiplies the unfaithful among men."
23,29,"Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaints? Who has needless bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes?"
23,30,"Those who linger over wine, who go to sample bowls of mixed wine."
23,31,"Do not gaze at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly!"
23,32,"In the end it bites like a snake and poisons like a viper."
23,33,"Your eyes will see strange sights and your mind imagine confusing things."
23,34,"You will be like one sleeping on the high seas, lying on top of the rigging."
23,35,"'They hit me,' you will say, 'but I'm not hurt! They beat me, but I don't feel it! When will I wake up so I can find another drink?'"

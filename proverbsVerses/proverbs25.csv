25,6,"Do not exalt yourslef in the king's presence, and do not claim a place among great men;"
25,7,"it is better for him to say to you, 'Come up here,' than for him to humiliate you before a nobleman. What you have seen with your eyes"
25,8,"do not bring hastily to court, for what will you do in the end if your neighbor puts you to to shame?"
25,9,"If you argue your case with a neighbor, do not betray another man's confidence,"
25,10,"or he who hears it may shame you and you will never lose your bad reputation."
25,11,"A word aptly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver."
25,12,"Like an earring of gold or an ornament of fine gold is a wise man's rebuke to a listening ear."

25,16,"If you find honey, eat just enough-- too much of it, and you will vomit."
25,17,"Seldom set foot in your neighbor's house-- too much of you, and he will hate you."
25,18,"Like a club or a sword or a sharp arrow is the man who gives false testimony against his neighbor."
25,19,"Like a bad tooth or a lame foot is reliance on the unfaithful in times of trouble."

25,23,"As a north wind brings rain, so a sly tongue brings angry looks."
25,24,"Better to live on a corner of the roof than share a house with a quarrelsome wife."
25,25,"Like cold water to a weary soul is good news from a distant land."
25,26,"Like a muddied spring or a polluted well is a righteous man who gives way to the wicked."
25,27,"It is not good to eat too much honey, nor is it honorable to seek one's own honor."
